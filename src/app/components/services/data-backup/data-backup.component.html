            One of the most critical functions any I.T. organization can undertake is ensuring a structured and highly formalized data
            backup policy and procedures are in place. After all, an organization without its data –or the inability to retrieve and restore
            such data in a complete, accurate, and timely manner –faces serious issues as a viable entity.

            Backups are a must, especially considering today’s growing regulatory compliance mandates and the ever-increasing cyber security
            threats for which business face on a daily basis. Yet even without compliance mandates, a well-though out, efficient, and
            reliable backup and recovery plan is a must for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical data. As
            for data backups or the process of “backing up”, it’s essentially the copying, storing – and possible restore and recovery –of
            computer data. Simply stated, data, in whatever format it may be in, should be regularly copied, then stored and archived
            accordingly, and available for possible restore and recovery, if necessary. Sounds straightforward –and it is –yet organizations
            struggle immensely with putting in place best practices such as these for backups.

            You can lose data any number of ways, and you’ll need to recover it for just as many reasons. Perhaps a new employee deleted a
            non-critical logo image. Perhaps you are the victim of a ransomware attack. Whatever it is, you will need to:

            • Recover mistakenly deleted data. <br />
            • Archive data for audits and taxes. <br />
            • Avoid closing your business due to data loss downtime.<br />
            • Increase productivity and effectiveness (don’t do the work twice!).<br />
